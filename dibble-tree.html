		<h3>The Dibble Tree has become the symbol of Carnoustie. It is located a few meters down Ferrier Street, where more information is available.</h3>
		<img src="images/dibble-tree.jpg" class="item-content-image">
		<p>Tammas Lousen was using a willow ‘dibble’ (planting stick) to plant out a relatively infertile plot of land and in the process grew tired and fell asleep. When he awoke, he had forgotten where he had left his dibble. Some months later he found
			it again but it had rooted. It grew into a fine specimen and became known as the Dibble Tree.</p>
		<p>The Dibble Tree has survived being hit by a lightning strike so severe that it split the trunk almost to the roots. (See picture). It has also spawned two clones that have been planted close by.</p>
